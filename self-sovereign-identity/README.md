# Self Sovereign Identity (SSI)
**Articles and documents associated with the fundamentals of Self Sovereign Identity.**

This directory was born from [/WebOfTrustInfo/self-sovereign-identity](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/self-sovereign-identity), the original SSI repository. I've done a bit of work over there, and decided to expand my efforts. The reason I got started on this is because I wanted to write an article about SSI. Then I saw the opportunity to help with its documentation.

The best overall article on the subject is still Christopher Allen's rallying cry: [The Path to Self-Sovereign Identity](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/self-sovereign-identity/blob/master/ThePathToSelf-SovereignIdentity.md). Christopher did an excellent job of outlining the history of internet identity standards, and introduces [10 Principles of Self-Sovereign Identity](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/self-sovereign-identity/blob/master/self-sovereign-identity-principles.md), currently in revision. Additionally, some criticism of the principles has been offered, and a considerable amount of additional material has been created. 

I began organizing some thoughts around the [Evolution of Self Sovereign Identity](evolution-of-ssi.md). The idea is to collect thought on SSI since 2016, and outline a few areas where I feel like the documentation could be improved. Once I've completed a review of existing literature on the subject, I'll put it into a google shared doc to encourage further participation.

In the mean-time, I'll adding all of the best SSI resources I can find here.
