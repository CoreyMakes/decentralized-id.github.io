**Awesome Self-Sovereign Identity, Decentralized-ID, and Blockchain-ID related resources.**

# Draft
Collaboration Welcome.

>Imagine a world where you are in direct control of your personal information; a world where you can limit and control how much information you share while retaining the ability to transact in the world. This is self-sovereign identity, and it is already here. Blockchain is the underlying technology paving the path to self-sovereign identity through decentralized networks. It ensures privacy and trust, where transactions are secure, authenticated and verifiable and endorsed by relevant, permissioned participants,'—[Jerry Cuomo - IBM](https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/10/the-promise-of-managing-identity-on-the-blockchain/)

### RWoT
Description = "The Web of Trust is a buzzword for a new model of decentralized self-sovereign identity. It’s a phrase that dates back almost twenty-five years, the classic definition derives from PGP.\n\nBut some use it as a term to include self-sovereign identity authentication & verification, certificate validation, and reputation assessment, while the vibrant blockchain community is also drawing new attention to the concept we aim to reboot it."
