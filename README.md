# awesome-decentralized-id v0.1

Grattitude to those who are working to make our identity experience, and the world, a better place.

[Collaboration Welcome](https://github.com/infominer33/awesome-decentralized-id/blob/master/contributing.md)

This is a skeleton, around which I will fill some context, rearrange things; introducing more\better resources as needed.

I expect to work on this quite a bit over the coming weeks, please excuse the mess. Knowing that people are looking at it has increased my motivation, I'll get it in order asap.

# Awesome Decentralized, Self-Sovereign, and Blockchain Identity resources

*Link abbreviations: (t)witter, (g)ithub, (wp)whitepaper, (wiki) is hard to abbreviate, (b)log, (v)ideo, (a)udio*

>Imagine a world where you are in direct control of your personal information; a world where you can limit and control how much information you share while retaining the ability to transact in the world. This is self-sovereign identity, and it is already here. Blockchain is the underlying technology paving the path to self-sovereign identity through decentralized networks. It ensures privacy and trust, where transactions are secure, authenticated and verifiable and endorsed by relevant, permissioned participants,'—[Jerry Cuomo - IBM](https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/10/the-promise-of-managing-identity-on-the-blockchain/)


## History

![](https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/IIW-blog.jpg)

### Internet Identity Workshop—IIW

In 2005, [Kaliya Young](https://identitywoman.net/)[[t](https://twitter.com/IdentityWoman)], [Phil Windley](https://windley.com)[[t](https://twitter.com/windley)], [Drummond Reed](https://www.evernym.com/)[[t](https://twitter.com/drummondreed)], and [Doc Searls](http://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/)[[t](https://twitter.com/dsearls)] hosted the first [Internet Identity Workshop](http://www.internetidentityworkshop.com/)[[t](https://twitter.com/idworkshop)] in Berkeley to discuss "architectural and governance proposals for Internet-wide identity services and their underlying philosophies." -[Announcing IIW 2005](https://identitywoman.net/announcing-the-internet-identity-workshop-iiw2005/)

Since then, the IIW has supported the development of the identity software ecosystem, including [OpenID](http://wiki.openid.net) ('05), OpenID [2.0](http://wiki.openid.net/w/page/12995215/OpenID%20Authentication%202-1)('06), [OAuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth)('10), [FIDO](https://fidoalliance.org/)('13) and OpenID [Connect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenID_Connect)('14). The heart of the internet identity community has been with empowering users and self-sovereign principles, since the early days. Only recently, have 'powers-that-be' recognized the virtues of decentralized systems.

* [*What is Sovereign Source Authority?*](https://www.moxytongue.com/2012/02/what-is-sovereign-source-authority.html) shows an early use of 'sovereign' in relation to our internet identities. The term "Self Sovereign Identity" which started becoming widely used in 2014.[[*1*]](https://www.tokencommons.org/Windhover-Principles-for-Digital-Identity-Trust-Data.html)[[*2*]](https://hubculture.com/hubs/47/news/689/) 
* [Christopher Allen](http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/)([t](https://twitter.com/ChristopherA))([g](https://github.com/ChristopherA)) details the overarching history of internet idenitity standards, in his seminal work: **[The Path to Self-Soverereign Identity](http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2016/04/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity.html)**[[*3*]](https://www.coindesk.com/path-self-sovereign-identity/amp/).

#### #Rebooting-Web-Of-Trust

The first [RWoT](http://www.WebOfTrust.info)[[g]](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/)  workshop was held during [November 2015](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rebooting-the-web-of-trust); attracting the likes of Vitalik Buterin, Peter Todd, Gregory Maxwell, Joel Dietz, Christopher Allen, and Jon Callas, [according to Andreas Antonopolis](https://news.bitcoin.com/andreas-antonopoulos-case-reputation-identity-systems/).


>The Web of Trust is a buzzword for a new model of decentralized self-sovereign identity. It’s a phrase that dates back almost twenty-five years, the classic definition derives from PGP.
>
>But some use it as a term to include self-sovereign identity authentication & verification, certificate validation, and reputation assessment, while the vibrant blockchain community is also drawing new attention to the concept we aim to reboot it. —[Rebranding the Web of Trust](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rebooting-the-web-of-trust/blob/master/final-documents/rebranding-web-of-trust.pdf)

#### IDEMix — Zero Knowledge Proof's in Evernym—Indy

>Our zero-knowledge proofs are part of the [Idemix protocol](http://domino.research.ibm.com/library/cyberdig.nsf/papers/EEB54FF3B91C1D648525759B004FBBB1/%24File/rz3730_revised.pdf), where they are used to prove the possession of [Camenisch-Lysyanskaya credentials](https://eprint.iacr.org/2001/019.pdf). We also use zero-knowledge proofs in the revocation protocol, which is based on [cryptographic accumulators](https://eprint.iacr.org/2008/539.pdf). —*[What Zero Knowledge Poof Algorithm is used in Sovrin?](https://forum.sovrin.org/t/what-zero-knowledge-proof-algorithm-is-used-in-sovrin/71/2)*

>Identity Mixer is not directly (re)implemented by Sovrin, but its cryptographic foundations are very similar, and Sovrin’s implementation includes most of its extended features (predicates, multi-credential, revocation, advanced issuance…). One of the researchers who helped to create Identity Mixer is on Sovrin’s Technical Governance Board and has offered insight to keep the implementations aligned on goals and methods. There is a separate effort to provide Identity Mixer features within Hyperledger Fabric, I believe–though I don’t know the details.

### Brought to you by: [The Crypto Library—Super Source](https://github.com/infominer33/Crypto-library)


A few of us are building a library of crypto knowledge on a discord server. Now those resources are migrating to github, to become a database and power web-portal\chat bot. I began working on this document after entering all of the DID resources I could find into [blockchain-id.toml](https://github.com/infominer33/awesome-decentralized-id/blob/master/blockchain-id.toml).  

Self-Sovereign Identity is one of my favorite subjects in crypto, which is how this became the [Crypto-library](https://github.com/infominer33/Crypto-library)'s first side-project. 

It's also market research, as we're figuring out how to monetize this monumental task / seeking sponsorship.

Any contribution would be greatly appreciated!!
