These documents have the beginnings of a structure. There is a contents, and besides the short history section, the rest is organized categorically. That can make it difficult to decide where to add a particular resource. Do your best to fit your pull request into the structure provided.

My personal standard is more information, always more.

I think I need to remove links from [awesome-decentralized-id](https://github.com/infominer33/awesome-decentralized-id/) that don't position themselves within the decentralized id standards community and are already mentioned in [blockchain-identity](https://github.com/peacekeeper/blockchain-identity/). I've also removed some sovrin\indy links from the awesome-decentralized-id so they can be featured more appropriately in [awesome-sovrin](https://github.com/infominer33/awesome-decentralized-id/blob/master/awesome-sovrin/).

I'm gradually getting more familiar with the material and learning how it all fits together. Feel free to share your ideas too.

Always interested to connect with other crypto-nerds, writers, and usually I hang out with developers. These lists serve as a great tool for writing and I've thought from the beginning that other freelance writers would find value in the [Crypto-library](https://github.com/infominer33/Crypto-library).
