These documents have the beginnings of a structure. There have a linked Contents section, and besides 'history', the rest is organized categorically. That can make it difficult to decide where to add a particular resource. Do your best to fit your pull request into the structure provided. I'm just learning how to use github with this project, so excuse me as I learn best practices.

My personal standard is more information, always more.

I think I need to remove links from [awesome-decentralized-id](https://github.com/infominer33/awesome-decentralized-id/) that don't position themselves within the decentralized id standards community and are already mentioned in [blockchain-identity](https://github.com/peacekeeper/blockchain-identity/). I've also removed some sovrin\indy links from the awesome-decentralized-id so they can be featured more appropriately in [awesome-sovrin](https://github.com/infominer33/awesome-decentralized-id/blob/master/awesome-sovrin/). The goal is to let each of these lists do its own job, while allowing for a sufficient amount of overlap.

I'm gradually getting more familiar with the material and learning how it all fits together. Feel free to share your ideas too.

Always interested to connect with other crypto-nerds, writers, and usually I hang out with developers. These lists serve as a great tool for writing. I've thought from the beginning that other writers writers and research enthusiasts would find value in the [Crypto-library](https://github.com/infominer33/Crypto-library).
