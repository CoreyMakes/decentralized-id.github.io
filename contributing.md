There isn't a firm structure yet, so hard to ask contributors to conform to a particular standard. 

My personal standard is more information, always more.

The decentralized-id [README](https://github.com/infominer33/awesome-decentralized-id/) is getting close to polished as far as I'm concerned. The Sovrin-Indy [README](https://github.com/infominer33/awesome-decentralized-id/blob/master/awesome-sovrin/) still needs more attention.

Always interested to connect with other crypto-nerds, writers, and usually I hang out with developers. These lists serve as a great tool for writing and I've thought from the beginning that other freelance writers would find value in the [Crypto-library](https://github.com/infominer33/Crypto-library).
