I'm not going to make contributing guidelines until there is more participation.

The decentralized-id [README](https://github.com/infominer33/awesome-decentralized-id/) is getting close to polished as far as I'm concerned, while there is still plenty of work to do on the Sovrin-Indy [README](https://github.com/infominer33/awesome-decentralized-id/blob/master/awesome-sovrin/).

Always interested to connect with other crypto-nerds, writers, and mostly I just hang out with developers. These lists serve as a great tool for writing and I've thought from the beginning that other freelance writers would find value in the [Crypto-library](https://github.com/infominer33/Crypto-library).
