At the moment this is just some notes on what I'm seeking as far as contributions. 

Seeking:

* All of the Links! 

Come on, I know you have some bookmarks folder full of awesome sauce! **Don't** hold out on me!

* To connect with other crypto research enthusiasts, and freelancers. 

Always interested to connect with others who spend more time studying the tech than the price of assets (although I'll be doing some of that too). Creating these collections is very useful for me as a writer, since I never know how deeply someone will want me to write on a subject. I've thought from the beginning that other freelance writers would find value in the [library](https://github.com/infominer33/Crypto-library).
