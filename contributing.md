Seeking:

* ideas about organizing the "Assorted" section
* any historical stuff.
* also, more recent stuff that I don't know about\haven't listed yet
* All of the Links! 

Come on, I know you have some bookmarks folder full of awesome sauce! **Don't** hold out on me! I would be happy to sort through them if you don't want to do all that... i do :D

* To connect with other crypto research enthusiasts, and freelancers. 
* IDK You tell ME what kind of contributions I'm looking for :D

Always interested to connect with others who spend more time studying the tech than the price of assets (although I'll be doing some of that too). Creating these collections is very useful for me as a writer, since I never know how deeply someone will want me to write on a subject. I've thought from the beginning that other freelance writers would find value in the [Crypto-library](https://github.com/infominer33/Crypto-library).

Used to be, my most valuable acts of a day were drinkin' IPAs and smokin' quality tobacco. 

Now, I curate n copywrite all day, every day.

I still smoke quality tobacco, I hope that's not going to be a problem.

I'm a newish freelancer progressing towards a livable wage, working primarily at crypto educational materials.
