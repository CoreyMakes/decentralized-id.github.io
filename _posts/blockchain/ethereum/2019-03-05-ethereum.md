### Element

* [Introducing Element](https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk/introducing-element-328b4260e757)
  > Transmute is excited to announce Element, an implementation of the Sidetree Protocol on top of Ethereum and IPFS. This work was done in collaboration with Microsoft and Consensys under the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF)
  > ...
  > We’re excited to use the serviceEndpoints defined in Element DID documents to track external integrations, in a privacy preserving manner, including identity hubs, credential stores, and more. Furthermore, the scalability that Sidetree brings to DIDs is unprecedented.

## Ethereum Enterprise Alliance

- [World’s Largest Blockchain Initiative Launches Three Working Groups](https://entethalliance.org/worlds-largest-blockchain-initiative-launches-three-working-groups/)
  > NEW YORK, N.Y., USA – December 19, 2017 ––The Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA), the world’s largest open-source blockchain initiative, launched today three new member-driven working groups in digital identity, energy and multiplatform interoperability. 

- [Enterprise Ethereum Alliance - Enterprise EthereumClient Specification V215 October 2018](https://entethalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/EEA_Enterprise_Ethereum_Client_Specification_V2.pdf)
  > The Infrastructure Contracts and Standards sublayer shows emerging standards outside theEnterprise Ethereum core specification. The components in this layer provide enablers for the applications built on top of them.Role Based Access Control (RBAC) defines methods for authentication and restricting system access to authorized users, potentially realized through smart contracts.Network Governance methods control which entities can join the network and hence assist withsafeguarding exchanges.Token standards provide common interfaces and methods along with best practices. These include[ERC-20], [ERC-223], [ERC-621], [ERC-721], and [ERC-827].

- [Enterprise Ethereum Alliance Permissioned Blockchains Specification v2](https://entethalliance.github.io/client-spec/chainspec.html) EEA Editor's Draft 01 November 2020
  > This document, the Enterprise Ethereum Blockchain Specification, defines requirements for Enterprise Ethereum blockchains to ensure they can be processed interoperably by Enterprise Ethereum clients that conform to the Enterprise Ethereum Client specification [EEA-client]. Its primary intended audience is operators of Enterprise Ethereum blockchains.
  > [...]\
  > **Credential Management Sublayer**\
  > Credentials, in the context of Enterprise Ethereum blockchains, refer to an individual’s cryptographic private keys, which are associated with that user’s Ethereum account.\
  > [...]\
  > This section presents a smart contract based registry, to provide on-chain validation that a particular Ethereum accounts or nodes is owned by a participating organization in an Enterprise Ethereum blockchain.\
  > [...]\
  > An Organization Registry follows the design outlined below.\
  > ORGIDS-300: Enterprise Ethereum Blockchains MAY implement a smart contract based Organization Registry that provides cryptographic bindings between Ethereum accounts and their owning organization with identity proofs.

## ERC-EIP

Identity related ERC-EIP

* [ERC: Lightweight Identity #1056](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/1056)   
  > This ERC describes a standard for creating and updating identities with a limited use of blockchain resources. An identity can have an unlimited number of delegates and attributes associated with it. Identity creation is as simple as creating a regular key pair ethereum account, which means that it's fee (no gas costs) and all ethereum accounts are valid identities. Furthermore this ERC is fully DID compliant.
* [ERC1056 ❤ ERC780 — an open identity and claims protocol for Ethereum](https://medium.com/uport/erc1056-erc780-an-open-identity-and-claims-protocol-for-ethereum-aef7207bc744)
* [EIP-780 Ethereum Claims Registry](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/780)

* [ERC-1484 Digital Identity Aggregator](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/1495) —A protocol for aggregating digital identity information that's broadly interoperable with existing, proposed, and hypothetical future digital identity standards.
* [EIP-1078](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/ed621645c8f3bc5756492f327cda015f35d9f8da/EIPS/eip-1078.md) - 
This presents a method to replace the usual signup/login design pattern with a minimal ethereum native scheme, that doesn’t require passwords, backing up private keys nor typing seed phrases.

### ERC725-735 

* [ERC725](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/725) 
  * The following describes standard functions for a unique identifiable proxy account to be used by humans, groups, organisations, objects and machines
* [ERC735](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/735) -  The following describes standard functions for adding, removing and holding of claims.
  - These claims can attested from third parties (issuers) or self attested.

* [EIDM: A Ethereum-Based Cloud User Identity Management Protocol](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8792212)
  > The new protocol is an improved version of CIDM (Consolidated Identity Management) referred to as EIDM (Ethrerum-based Identity Management) protocol. In the improved protocol, JWT (JSON Web Token) in OAuth 2.0 was used to introduce smart contracts into EIDM protocol, and the credit management system was added to the system so that it can provide a credible identity authentication protocol for cloud users and service providers.
