Eventually there will be a section with individual pages for the various influential and\or prominent members of the DID\SSI community. But I wasn't sure where to start... 

I decided to start by featuring Women in Identity first, and expand from there.

    >The Future of Property Rights a program at New America just published a new report [The Nail Finds a Hammer: Self-Sovereign Identity, Design Principles and Property Rights in the Developing World.](https://www.newamerica.org/future-property-rights/reports/nail-finds-hammer/) I commented extensively on the paper before publication and they included the Domains of Identity within the report. It turns out that many of the Domains of Identity include registries. This whole perspective that registries as the root of many of our systems is very eye opening. Just like when one finds identity one sees it everywhere, it turns our registries are everywhere too.
