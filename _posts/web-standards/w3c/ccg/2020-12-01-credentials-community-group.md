W3C	Credentials Community Group	The mission of the W3C Credentials Community Group is to explore the creation, storage, presentation, verification, and user control of credentials. We focus on a verifiable credential (a set of claims) created by an issuer about a subject—a person, group, or thing—and seek solutions inclusive of approaches such as: self-sovereign identity; presentation of proofs by the bearer; data minimization; and centralized, federated, and decentralized registry and identity systems. Our tasks include drafting and incubating Internet specifications for further standardization and prototyping and testing reference implementations.	https://www.w3.org/community/credentials/		https://www.w3.org/community/credentials/feed/	public-credentials-request@w3.org	https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/	https://github.com/w3c-ccg
