Infominer, here. Just want to give a bit of an introduction to this site, share a bit of my philosophy around how I work, and why I built it.

I hadn't been involved with tech for nearly a decade, and came back excited about how the internet and software landscape had matured, in the blink of an eye. Initially, I advertised freelance writing services, for detail oriented, research based, content. However, I saw such a great need for quality references. It felt impossibile for anyone to do a good job writing about anything they hadn't already become immersed in.

I've become consumed with the idea of making curated lists for all the things, and make complex subjects easier to navigate, much more quickly than I could write about all the things. I'm just doing what I see needs to be done.

The landscape is moving quickly, and so I'm just building out a map, as able. I'd also welcome any effort from visitors who feel inspired to spruce up a page, here and there, or potentially add pages \ sections. If not, I'll get around to it all, eventually. 

The idea has always been for this to be a collaborative effort. Soon, there will be a public mailing list, as that seems to be how decentralized organizations actually work online. 

I've found some work gathering information related to agents. That is all I wanted, when I started this project last year. That somehow my newfound passion for making curated lists, where I see the need, might develop into opportunities for gainful employ, doing the same. 

The work is greatly improving my domain knowledge and experience. However, all of that isn't available for publication under my NDA. Regardless, it helps to cement the relevance of this resource, and offers some incentive for me to update this site with the plentiful material I'd had waiting for the opportunity to work with.
