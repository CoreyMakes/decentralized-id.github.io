Infominer, here. Just want to give a bit of an introduction to this site, share a bit of my philosophy around how I work, and why I built it.

I came into the Bitcoin space, mid 2017, around the time I began looking for work writing research based content.

I hadn't been involved with tech for nearly a decade, but I was excited about the idea of getting paid to learn, and how computers and the internet landscape had matured, in my absence. 

Initially, I advertised freelance writing services, for detail oriented, research based, content. I found it very difficult to both learn what was required for articles I was hired for, and find a quality\authoritative reference to use for the article. I saw such a great need for quality references, It felt impossibile for anyone to do a good job writing about anything they hadn't already become immersed in.

I've since become consumed with the idea of making curated lists for some of the tech topics I'm most interested in. In this way, I make complex subjects easier to navigate, much more quickly than I could write about all the things. Meanwhile, curated list of references enables the creation of a variety of articles. So while I may be slow at filling in some commentary around the lists, it makes a solid base for further exploration.

In its first iteration, this site was an "[awesome list](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)", but it quickly outgrew that model. I saw that decentralized identity had a long history, and I could see how it would be _the_ blockchain use-case, beyond currency and would unlock a large number of the usecases people were trying to bake inside a consensus algorithm.

The landscape is moving quickly, and so I'm just building out a map, as able. I'd also welcome any effort from visitors who feel inspired to spruce up a page, here and there, or potentially add pages \ sections. If not, I'll get around to it all, eventually. 

The idea has always been for this to be a collaborative effort. Soon, there will be a public mailing list, as that seems to be how decentralized organizations actually work online. 

I feel blessed to have had such meaningful learning experience and initiation into digital identity.

Thanks for Visiting, and taking the time to read this note.
