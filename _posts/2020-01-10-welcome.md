Welcome! 

I discovered decentralized identity as a freelance content creator, when I was hired to write a few in-depth articles about Hyperledger Indy. Inspired by @peacekeeper's [blockchain-identity](https://github.com/peacekeeper/blockchain-identity/) list on GitHub, I began working on my own **curated list of resources related to decentralized identity**.

I saw that decentralized identity had a long history, and that it could be _the_ blockchain use-case, beyond currency. I knew this community had a need for this organization of it's information, and that I could find my way into some profitable ventures doing so.

At some point, I connected with Kaliya @identitywoman who has ever been working on similar efforts, to map out the organizations and protocols surrounding decentralized-identity, and has become something of an editorial advisor. Juan @by_caballero has gotten his hands dirty working on related projects, and sometimes assists in curation. 

A few others have become friends to this effort, even if they haven't technically contributed to the site. Among those is [Kyle Den Hartog](https://kyledenhartog.com/) who financially supported some of my work in curating these peer-to-peer histories, which eventually may be adapted for this site.

## Feel free to reach out.
 
The landscape is moving quickly, and so I'm just filling out and discovering a map of the territory, as able. The idea has always been for this to be a collaborative effort. If you'd like to participate, feel free to reach out on twitter (@DecentralizeID or @infominer33), by email (identity.decentralized [at] gmail.com), or send a carrier pigeon according to the customary protocols.
