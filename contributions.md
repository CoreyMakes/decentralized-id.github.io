Help wanted:

* organization, generally.... there is likely some better way to organize these resources that I haven't considered.
* sorting the "Assorted" section would be appreciated, maybe it could use a bit of pruning and\or adding to.
* supporting links for any projects mentioned
* it would be great to know if any projects\organizations deserve more attention than they're currrently getting.
* RWoT papers are an epic collection, still need to figure out a "greatest hits" kind of list rather than the semi-random assortment I have so far.

Also, it'd be nice to talk w someone who's familiar with the early history of the Self Sovereign ID movement and the relationshiop between IIW, RWoT, UN, and W3C. I'm manually working those details out myself the best I can, but of course, getting a chance to chat with someone who was there or knows about it would be great. 

I'm just a beginning freelancer trying to find a livable wage through a passion I stumbled upon around a year ago: Bitcoin, Blockchain, Crypto, Decentralization, Internet Research, and creating Information-Dense, Evergreen Content. 

Any support is appreciated: 1GvkjHtiy9LUjVkStnEAXxjhcoS56aCokY
