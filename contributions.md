Help wanted:

* organization, generally
* sorting the "Assorted" section would be appreciated, maybe it could use a bit of pruning and\or adding to.
* supporting links for projects mentioned

It'd be nice to talk w someone who's familiar with the early history such as *exactly* when "Self Sovereign" and the relationshiop between IIW and RWoT.

Generally speaking, it would be great to be able to chat with someone who has more of a history with DID community\movement. 

I'm just a beginning freelancer trying to find a livable wage through my passion: Blockchain, Crypto, Decentralization, and Internet Research.  

Any support is appreciated more than you can know: 1GvkjHtiy9LUjVkStnEAXxjhcoS56aCokY
