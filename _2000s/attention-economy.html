Search for &quot;Steve Gillmor&quot; and Attention on Google, and 113,000 results come up.
&gt; 
&gt; Steve is a good friend. I&#39;m a member of his weekly Gillmor Gang podcast. He&#39;s talked about attention many times on many shows, and even has a radio show on Sirius called Attention Tech. And yet, I&#39;ve got to admit, I&#39;ve never understood more than a fraction of what he&#39;s talking about Â— even when I&#39;ve given him my full attention. (Which isn&#39;t easy for a techie typically given to &quot;continuous partial attention&quot;, as Linda Stone pointed out in one of eTech&#39;s best talks.)</span>
